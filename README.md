# bus-route-challenge

In this activity I had use the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. Then, I added an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes.
The instructions and starter code are marked.

In order to run this challenge all you need to do is to click the button at the top of webpage and a tracker will appear along the bus route between Havard and MIT.

Some future improvements I could make to this project would be to add live tracking of buses or closest bus stop to the users location.
